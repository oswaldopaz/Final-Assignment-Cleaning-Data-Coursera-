 The present code book covers the final result in the form of data frame that was obtained after manipulating and making an initial analysis
 of some raw data produced by the following series of experiments (extracted from the original):
 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 


The data frame resulting from the script contains the following information in a table that is 83 columns wide (variables) and 180 long (observations):

- A first column variable with an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- A second column variable with the corresponding activity label (see the 6 activities described above). 
- The other 81 columns with the rest of variables for the different measurements, narrowed down from the original 561 measures.

The dataset only includes two files, the actual script (run_Analysis.R) and its corresponding README.txt file.

===================
For further clarification about the nature of teh measurements, an extract (adapted) of the original information follows:

The subset of features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcc-XYZ and timeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals  were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAcc-XYZ and timeGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccMag, timeGravityAccMag, timeBodyAccJerkMag, timeBodyGyroMag, timeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing freqBodyAcc-XYZ, freqBodyAccJerk-XYZ, freqBodyGyro-XYZ, freqBodyAccJerkMag, freqBodyGyroMag, freqBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'freq' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The first variable "Subject" ranges from 1 to 30 and no further information is provided. The second variable "Activity" is self-explanatory, as described above, and includes: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING.
